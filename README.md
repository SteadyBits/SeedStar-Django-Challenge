# SeedStar-Django-Challenge
SeedStar Django Software Engineering Challenge
JetBrains PyCharm IDE was employed in building the app.
The app makes use of the SQLite database, there are some records already in the database.
You can create an admin user with the command: 'createsuperuser' so you could login to https://localhost:8000/admin.
The app is responsive and secured, and can run on any of the modern browsers.
ENJOY!!!
